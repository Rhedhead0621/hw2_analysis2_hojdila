    "# Reading JSON data\n",

    "This notebook is based on the **JSON Data** section Chapter 3 of [Data Wrangling with Python (DWwP)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-wrangling-with/9781491948804/).\n",

    "JSON is a widely used, lightweight, human and machine readable, data interchange format. You can find the JSON spec at http://www.json.org/. JSON leans on two main data structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a collection of name/value pairs. We call these pairs, *objects*.\n",
    "- an ordered list of values. We call these *arrays*. \n",
    "\n",
    "A collection of name value pairs looks suspiciously like a Python dict. The ordered list of values looks like a Python list in that it starts and ends with square brackets and the items are separated by commas. The values in the arrays can be simple things like strings or numbers but can also be more complicated things like objects or another array. We can nest as much as we want.\n",

    "We've learned how to use Python's built in `json` library to read JSON files into a list of dictionaries. This is a common precursor to doing data cleanup and other data preparation tasks before moving on to data analysis. As you start working with more complex JSON files, you'll come to appreciate the flexibility provided by Python dictionaries. For example, the *value* in a *key-value* pair in a dictionary can itself be another dictionary! This makes it easy to store and manipulate hierarchical data. Not all data is tabular. For example, consider this index of files available at one of the SEC web pages: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/full-index/2019/QTR1/index.json"
